# Templates

Fiberplane Templates are powerful tools to create programmatic DevOps workflows for monitoring, debugging your infrastructure, and responding to incidents.

Fiberplane Templates are built using [Jsonnet data templating language](https://jsonnet.org/). You can find some useful examples to get you started in this repo.

-   [Incident Response](./incident-response-pagerduty) - a sample PagerDuty-to-Fiberplane workflow to help run your incident response
-   [Incident Analysis / Postmortem](./incident-analysis) - to help you analyze what went wrong and what steps to take to mediate or prevent the incident in the future
-   [Meeting Notes](./meeting-notes) - to run your weekly SRE meetings and reviews
