# Fiberplane Starter-Kits :rocket:

Fiberplane starter-kits aim to help you get an experience of how Fiberplane can be used within your infrastructure to ease troubleshooting incidents. These use Docker Compose to run instances of Prometheus, Loki, Elastic and Fiberplane Proxy as Docker containers on your host of choice (Linux or MacOS) so that you can take it for a spin.

The full documentation for using these can be found on our [documentation site](https://docs.fiberplane.com).
