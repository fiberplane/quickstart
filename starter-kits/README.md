# Fiberplane Starter-Kits :rocket:

Fiberplane starter-kits aim to help you get an experience of how Fiberplane can
be used within your infrastructure to ease troubleshooting incidents. These use
Docker Compose to run instances of Prometheus, Loki, Elastic and Fiberplane
Daemon as Docker containers on your host of choice (Linux or MacOS) so that you
can take it for a spin.

The full documentation for using these can be found on our [documentation site](https://docs.fiberplane.com).
